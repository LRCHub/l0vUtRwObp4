Sleep walk
Seems like the other day
My baby went away
He went away cause the seaaaaaa
It' been two years of soul
Since I saw my baby go
And then this letter came for meeee
It said that we were through
He found somebody new
Let me think
Let me think
What can I do
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no no nonono
What can I decideee
What can I
He's smile was so inviting
His mouth so exciting
Then he touched my teeth
With his fingertips
Softly
Softly
Softly
We meet oooooo we meet
Oh what do I have do to
The boy that I was true
Oh the boy said he and me through
Ohhhhhhhhhhh
Oohhhh what I'm gonna do
With the life I gave to you
Oh what do I do with the night
Oh
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no no no
